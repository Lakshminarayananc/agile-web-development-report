Agile Web Development course, spring 2008
=========================================


Abstract
--------

We organized a thirteen-day Agile Web Development course at Department of Software Systems at Tampere University of Technology in April 2008. The goal of the course was to teach students agile development practices and web programming in a fast-paced project with real customers. 

The daily sessions started at 9:00 each morning and lasted till 16:00, with a one-hour lunch break at the middle of the day. First three days were preparation for the project assignment. On the remaining ten days, lectures and exercises were intertwined with project work. 

Ten students enrolled to the course. Students were divided into five teams of two, with each team working on a separate project. By the end of the course, all teams delivered working software to their customers - albeit without deployment to production use. The customers in general were happy with the results.

We did not achieve all of the educational goals of the course. In particular, test-driven development was planned to be used in project work, but in the end was not. The technical difficulties in learning a new programming language and a new framework were higher than expected. We assessed that mandating test-driven development would cause confusion, frustrate students and interfere with learning.

Feedback from students was very positive.

We propose that the same course be given next year with a few changes. Most notably, to ease wrestling with technical issues during the project work and to allow more focus on agile programming practices, the course preparation period should be lengthened from three days to five, bringing the total length of the course to fifteen days. We also propose creation of another course "Agile customership", 1 cu.


Introduction
------------

This report describes organizing an Agile Web Development (AWD) course at Department of Software Systems at Tampere University of Technology in April 2008.

In this report, we describe (a) the goals of the course, (b) how the course was structured to achieve those goals, (c) experiences from the actual course implementation, (d) the feedback from students and customers, and finally (e) the changes we propose for the next year's course.


Goals
-----

The course had two educational goals.

1. To teach students agile principles and methods in practice. 
2. To teach them programming with a modern web framework.



Agile methods are ways to achieve the agile principles in practice. They are important but somewhat meaningless without the understanding of the principles. The priority of the course was to teach test-driven development and scrum project management. In addition, should time allow, continuous integration, refactoring, pair programming and retrospectives were to be included.

Web programming...


In addition to the educational goals, the course had two other goals: 

1. To test a new kind of a course in the university.
2. To bring experiences from the industry back to the university.




Planned structure
-----------------

* first week: three days preparation
  * first day: Ruby
  * second day: TDD, RSpec
  * third day: Ruby on Rails

* second week: sprint 1
  * first day of project work: planning
  * goals of sprint 1

* third week: sprint 2
  * goals of sprint 2

Implementation
--------------

* student enrollment

* deviance from the plan
  * teaching slower
  * agile part smaller: 1. no TDD 2. Scrum not really Scrum
  * less dialogue with customer

* impressions of student work
  * enthusiasm
  * focus on technical issues
  * two groups: those who were interested in agile and those who weren't. roughly corresponded to Finns-foreigners

* link to course diary

Feedback
--------

* student feedback
  * 

* customer feedback
  * generally satisfied
  * wished 

* feedback from prof Bormann
  * 


Summary
-------

* course was a partial success
  * was beneficial the way it was
  * didn't achieve all goals
  * can be much better

### Proposed changes for next year

* longer course
* course for customers



Appendix
--------

### Origins

The course was modeled after an Agile Web Entwicklung course held at the University of Bremen by prof. Carsten Bormann. In the end there were many differences between the courses. 

The Bremen course is a much more intensive period, consisting of 12 days of 12 hour work, including one weekend. There were two reasons why the intensity of the Bremen course was not emulated in the Tampere course.

* Firstly, such intensity is foreign to the culture at TUT. We feared it would be difficult to attract students to the course. This was later confirmed by student feedback. It could also be difficult to convince the university administration to approve such a course. 
* Secondly, working 12 hour days is opposed to ideals of agile development. Our goal was to teach students sustainable practices that they could later emulate later in their careers.

### Credit units and relation to OHJ-5100 Web programming course

The Agile Web Development course was offered in two ways: (a) as an independent course and (b) in conjunction with OHJ-5100 Web Programming course. The independent course was worth 3 credit points. Passing the independent course required attendance to teaching and finishing the assignment successfully.

In conjunction with OHJ-5100, the course replaced the normal J2EE assignment, two lectures and three weekly exercises of OHJ-5100. The total course credit was 6 credit points: 4 credit points from OHJ-5100 and 2 credit points from 2 credit points from AWD. Passing the two courses required attendance to AWD teaching, successfully finishing the AWD assignment, finishing at least four OHJ-5100 weekly exercises and passing the OHJ-5100 exam.

Of the ten students enrolled to the course, nine took the course in conjunction with OHJ-5100.
