This is the final lecture from the Agile Web Development course. I gave on 2008-04-25. I paraphrased it from memory and saved it here on 2008-05-31. -- antti.tarvainen@iki.fi

People over processes
=====================

(Show them the agile manifesto values slide.) You remember this slide, don't you? These are all important values, but in my opinion the most important one is People over Processes. So what does it mean? Let's talk about that.

We finished all our projects and had good fun doing it. This agile development thing is pretty good, isn't it?

I can tell what makes it good: you work to solve a real problem, and you have the power to make the solution work. You can choose the answers to the important questions. If you don't think the requirements are right you can change them. If you don't think the design is going to work, you can change it by yourself. Power to choose is what makes life good.

I advertised this as a course with a real-life project. So the work in the industry must be pretty good? Projects succeed and it's fun, right?

Well, not quite. (Show them the CHAOS report pie chart.) In real life projects fail. And they fail a lot.

And let me tell you another thing: people are not very happy. We have a wonderful job, but we cannot enjoy it, because our project are failings and because we do not have the power to change them.

So why don't we have the power?

(Show them a hand drawn chart of a hierarchical tree organization.) Here's a typical software project. And here's the customer. (Point to a stick figure outside the tree.)

The customer writes a specification and gives the spec to one of these guys. (Point to the guy in the root of the tree.) He doesn't need to be the boss, but the point here is that he's not a coder. Now this person designs the software architecture and gives it down to these guys and so on until it ends up with the coders.

Now things always go wrong, in traditional software process and in agile as well. So one day this coder here realizes that what he does won't work. It doesn't make any sense.

But he doesn't have the power to make the software work. After all, he can only make small decisions, since he is responsible for only one small part of the software. So he becomes powerless and unhappy.

Maybe this guy here, who designed the architecture, sees that something is going wrong. But he cannot do anything either, because he has handed down all the specs to lower levels. The coding is going on, and he cannot do anything, because his part is already done. So he becomes frustrated and unhappy.

The result is that the organization slowly becomes frustrated. And then each person has two choices: They can try to make the change they don't have power to do and become even more frustrated. Or they can become cynical and just stop caring. This is what a lot of developers do.

What is the solution? Agile development, of course! Instead of having separate layers of people and lots of hand-offs, we have one team that has the power to make changes when they are needed.

The important question is, how do you make sure you can work in an agile manner?

Well, first of all, agile is hard. Being a cynical worker in a traditional organization is easy and its fun if you like your life resembling a Dilbert comic. It's easy because you don't have power and you don't have responsibility, but it's frustrating for exactly those same reasons. But working in agile way is different.

Before anyone will grant you all the power that agile methods demand, you need to show that you are up to it. You need two things: responsibility and skills.

An agile developer needs to take responsibility for the software. What does it mean? Does it mean that you have to stay late fixing bugs if the software does not work? No, of course not! It means that you have to follow carefully how the project works and be very honest about it. Whenever you see a problem, you have to tell about it! This is what responsibility means. It's simple but it may not always be easy.

But you have to be more than responsible: you have to have skills. Agile works best when the team is small. So you have to be good, as good as two average programmers or better.

You have to realize that you are not a great programmer when you graduate from this university. The learning continues at work and on your free time. You need to want to improve. I am not nearly as good as I want to be.

So how do you make sure you keep improving? My advice is this: do something on your free time. Learn a new programming language, read a book, read blogs, write a blog, attend a local user group. You don't have to do everything. The important thing is to do things you like. I like reading books so I read a lot.

Another thing I thought would be neat was to actually lecture a course in the university. So I went to the professors this department and asked if I could come and hold a course on Agile Web Development. And they said no.

But that was alright, since they thought this could be an optional part of the Web Programming course. And because some of you don't actually take the Web Programming course after all, this became a course of its own, and I can call myself a lecturer.

The point here is that there are dozens of things that are exciting that you can do to become better and better. Just choose the one that feels the best.

However, becoming better is only one part of this. Most software companies are not very agile. To work in an agile manner, you don't need to change only yourself, you have to change your company.

What can you do? Most probably you are this guy here (point to one of the coders on the organization chart) and you don't have the power to make the decisions. How can you change the organization?

The way to do it is to be a catalyst for change. For example, let's say you want to introduce test-driven development in your company. How do you do that?

You can choose the way *you* work, so you start by using TDD yourself. After you are confident with that you show it to your team mates. You don't need to show it to your boss, because he probably won't understand it. But your team mates will. If you can demonstrate to them that it works, they will start using it. Then once your boss sees that you are all using TDD, he will realize that it's actually a good idea and the company change will become faster.

This may not work. If it doesn't then may be it's time to think of moving to another company. There's no need for you to feel unhappy if there are better organizations out there.

So when you go to work in a software company, remember this course. Our work can be very much fun when it is done correctly. Companies can change but it will take time. Work to become better and to make your company better. Fight cynicism and become powerful.

And that's all I have to say. Thanks for attending the course.
